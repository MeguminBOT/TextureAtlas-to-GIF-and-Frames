## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- ⚠️ **Input image format**: Currently supports PNG texture atlases only
- ⚠️ **Static thread and memory usage**: Currently uses the resources you tell it to without any dynamic managing of system resources.
- ⚠️ **False positive virus (Windows only)**: Some anti-virus software flags compiled Python code as malware. Read [this](https://github.com/MeguminBOT/TextureAtlas-to-GIF-and-Frames/issues/20) for more info

## 🔮 Planned Features

- 📚 **QT graphical interface**: Swapping to QT based UI. (Repo maintainer will do the initial work in a branch named "QT", afterwards any help is welcome) 
- 🔄 **Command-line interface**: Full CLI support for automation and scripting
- 🖼️ **Additional input formats**: Support for more image formats beyond PNG
- 🖱️ **Drag & drop support**: Easier file loading interface
- 🔌 **Custom FFMPEG output**: Custom output formats through FFMPEG
