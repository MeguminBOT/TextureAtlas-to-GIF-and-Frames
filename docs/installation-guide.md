## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 11+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 11+/Fedora 36+)
- **CPU**: At least 2 cores (dual-core or better required)
- **Python**: Version 3.14 or higher
- **RAM**: At least 8GB
- **Storage**: 1GB for application + output of single spritesheet processing (5GB+ recommended
  for batch processing)
- **Internet Access**: Required for downloading dependencies and updates

### Recommended Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit), macOS 11+ (Big Sur or later), or recent Linux
  (Ubuntu 22.04+/Fedora 38+)
- **CPU**: Quad-core or better
- **Python**: Version 3.14 or higher (64-bit)
- **RAM**: 16GB or more (32GB+ recommended for batch processing large atlases or Adobe Animate
  spritemaps)
- **Storage**: SSD with 10GB+ free space for faster processing speeds (a regular hard drive
  will suffice for smaller workloads)
- **Internet Access**: Required for downloading dependencies and updates

> **⚠️ Important Notices:**
> - 32-bit operating systems are **not officially supported** and will **not receive
>   troubleshooting help**.
> - Operating systems below macOS 11, Windows 10, and older Linux distributions are **not
>   officially supported** and will **not receive troubleshooting help**.
> - Python versions below 3.14 are **not officially supported** and will **not receive
>   troubleshooting help**.

### Performance Notes
> ⚠️ **Adobe Animate Spritemap Extraction**  
> Extracting Adobe Animate spritemaps (the `Animation.json` + `sheet.json` pairs) is
> significantly more memory-intensive than other formats. Each spritemap typically requires
> decompressing high-resolution frames and rebuilding matrix transformations. **Expect
> substantially higher RAM and CPU usage during these operations.**  
> - For large Adobe Animate atlases, close other memory-heavy applications before processing.
> - Consider reducing the number of worker threads if you encounter out-of-memory errors.
> - An SSD is strongly recommended for caching intermediate frames.

## Normal Install (Windows only)

> ⚠️ **Antivirus False Positives**  
> The Windows executable releases are **very likely to be flagged as malware** by antivirus
> software. This is a common false positive for Python applications compiled with tools like
> Nuitka or PyInstaller. The application is open-source and safe—you can verify the code
> yourself. If your antivirus blocks or quarantines the executable:
> - Add an exception for the `TextureAtlas Toolbox.exe` file or the installation folder.
> - Alternatively, use the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) method to run from
>   source, which avoids this issue entirely.
> - You can also [compile the application yourself](#compiling-from-source-windows) using the
>   provided build script, but this requires doing the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) anyways.

1. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/MeguminBOT/TextureAtlas-to-GIF-and-Frames/releases).
2. Download the latest release ZIP or 7z file.
3. Extract all files to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\TextureAtlasToolbox`).
4. Run `TextureAtlas Toolbox.exe`.

## Manual Installation

**For the Advanced users, developers or Mac/Linux users**:

This will guide you through how to install Python and the required dependencies to run the app directly from the .py scripts.


### Python Installation

#### Windows

1. Download Python 3.14+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Important**: During installation, check the box for **"Add Python to PATH"**.
3. Complete the installation.
4. Open Command Prompt and verify installation:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```
   If you see a version number (e.g., `Python 3.14.0`), Python is installed correctly.

#### macOS

1. **Recommended**: Install Homebrew if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Python:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Update package lists:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Python and pip:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

### Installing Python Dependencies

#### Using requirements.txt (Recommended Stable Build)

**Windows:**

The `setup/setup_windows.bat` script automates the entire setup process:

1. **Double-click** or run `setup/setup_windows.bat` from the project folder.
2. The script performs the following steps automatically:
   - **Detects Python**: Checks for `py`, `python`, or common installation paths.
   - **Validates version**: Ensures Python 3.14+ is available.
   - **Installs Python if missing**: Downloads and silently installs Python 3.14.x (64-bit) from
     python.org, adding it to your PATH. You may be prompted for administrator approval.
   - **Upgrades pip**: Updates pip to the latest version.
   - **Prompts for dependency install**: Asks whether to install dependencies.
   - **Lets you choose stable or experimental**: Select option 1 for `requirements.txt` (stable)
     or option 2 for `requirements-experimental.txt` (bleeding-edge).
   - **Installs dependencies**: Runs `pip install --upgrade --user` with your chosen file.
   - **Adds Scripts to PATH**: Automatically adds the Python Scripts directory to your user PATH
     so tools like `pip` work in new terminal sessions.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the setup script prompts here -->
<!-- ![Windows setup script](images/setup-windows.png) -->

If you prefer manual steps, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project root
directory, and run:
```powershell
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
```
If you encounter permission errors, try:
```powershell
python -m pip install --user -r setup/requirements.txt
```
Need the bleeding-edge dependency set? Replace `requirements.txt` with
`requirements-experimental.txt` in the commands above.

**macOS:**

1. Open Terminal and run the setup script:
   ```bash
   bash setup/setup_macOSX.sh
   ```
   This will attempt to install all required dependencies automatically. Note that the `.sh`
   script for macOS is experimental and not extensively tested.
2. If you prefer manual steps, navigate to the project root directory and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
   ```
   If you encounter permission errors, try:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --user -r setup/requirements.txt
   ```
   For the experimental stack, swap in `setup/requirements-experimental.txt`.

**Linux:**

1. Open a terminal, navigate to the project root directory, and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
   ```
   If you encounter permission errors, try:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --user -r setup/requirements.txt
   ```
   Swap the filename with `setup/requirements-experimental.txt` if you prefer the less-tested
   dependency set.
